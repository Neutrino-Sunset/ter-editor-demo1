# ter-editor-demo1

## Overview

Demonstrates some issues I'm having attempting to modify the RTF buffer of the Ter edit control.

It's a NodeJs Express application.

With NodeJs installed run `npm i` to load dependencies.

Run `npm start` in the project directory to run it.

Navigate to `localhost:3000` in a browser.

## Next Steps

Refactor the insert-rtf page along the lines of repeats-demo. DONE
